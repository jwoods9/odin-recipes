        <h2>Soul food with flair</h2>
        <p>When entertaining guests on special occasions, don't 
            forget that you're putting on a show with the food. 
            And, when it comes to starchy side dishes, these 
            potatoes are a great way to express flair for the 
            dramatic.</p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>4 large russet potatoes</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons vegetable oil</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon minced green onion</li>
                <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
                <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
                <li>1/2 cup shredded white cheddar cheese</li>
                <li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li>
                <li>1 egg yolk</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon butter, melted</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). 
                    Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. </li>
                    <br />
                <li>Rub potatoes with vegetable oil and place on the 
                    prepared baking sheet.</li>
                    <br />
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a paring knife 
                    easily inserts into the center of a potato, about 
                    1 hour. Set aside to cool until easy to handle, 
                    about 10 minutes.</li>
                    <br />
                <li>Cut 1/3 off each potato lengthwise. Scoop flesh 
                    from each potato to within about 1/8-inch of the 
                    skins. Transfer flesh to a bowl.</li>
                    <br />
                <li>Combine potato flesh with butter and green onion; 
                    stir until butter is melted evenly into potato. 
                    Add salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and cheese; 
                    stir until cheese is melted. Pour cream and egg yolk 
                    into potato mixture; mix to combine. Season with salt 
                    to taste.</li>
                    <br />
                <li>Place small piece of potato skin inside the bottom 
                    of each larger potato shell. Fill each potato with 
                    an equal amount of cheese mixture. Gently press the 
                    surface of the filling with a fork to create texture. 
                    Brush tops with melted butter and sprinkle with 
                    paprika.</li>
                    <br />
                <li>Bake stuffed potatoes until golden brown on top, 
                    20 to 30 minutes.</li>
            </ol>
