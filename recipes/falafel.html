        <h2>Fast food from afar</h2>
        <p>Unlike most of America's other favorite fast foods, 
            falafel is rarely attempted at home, which is a shame, 
            since it's very simple to do, and even a relative 
            novice like me can get some very decent results. 
            One word of warning: you do need to know you're going 
            to have a craving for this a full day before you actually 
            want to eat it.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup dry garbanzo beans</li>
                <li>1/2 yellow onion, diced</li>
                <li>1/2 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
                <li>4 cloves minced garlic</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour, or more as needed</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons lemon juice</li>
                <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt, or to taste</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
                <li>Oil for frying</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Place garbanzo beans into a large container and cover 
                    with several inches of cool water; let stand 12 to 24 
                    hours. Drain. </li>
                    <br />
                <li>Blend garbanzo beans, onion, parsley, garlic, flour, 
                    lemon juice, salt, cumin, coriander, baking soda, 
                    and cayenne pepper together in a food processor, 
                    scraping down the sides of the bowl as necessary, 
                    until mixture is finely ground and holds together 
                    when pressed. Transfer garbanzo mixture to a bowl, 
                    cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until flavors 
                    blend, 1 to 2 hours. </li>
                    <br />
                <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 
                    350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
                    <br />
                <li>Divide dough into 12 portions and roll each with 
                    moistened hands into a ball.</li>
                    <br />
                <li>Working in batches, cook falafel balls in hot oil until 
                    browned and crispy, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a wire 
                    rack to drain. </li>    
            </ol>
