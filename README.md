# odin-recipes

Odin-recipes is the first project encountered during TheOdinProject.com's Foundations Course,
and my first foray into html. I learned how to create a main page (the index.html), which can then
be used to link to other pages as needed. Besides being able to link multiple pages together, 
I also learned how to insert pictures, create appropriately ordered headings, use both ordered and 
unordered lists, and, perhaps most importantly, track my progress using Git.
